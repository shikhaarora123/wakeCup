          The year was 1980 when WakeCup was imagined after experiencing some of
          the finest coffees on an educational trip to Brazil and the South
          Americas. We wanted to break the monotony of low profile, non-descript
          coffee that was doing rounds in those cafeterias of the 80s. But life
          threw us in a different direction, and we ended up in the tech
          industry with a desire to get into the world of coffee someday. In
          2005, that dream was brought to fruition when we quit our jobs and
          started WakeCup. Ever since then, we’ve gone around the world in
          search for the best beans and we couldn’t be happier. We love
          spreading smiles through our coffee. Our quest has taken us around the
          world to some of the finest plantations and estates, many of whom work
          with us directly or indirectly. In 2016 we started conducting
          workshops and became the primary sponsors of the Bean King Champion
          contest. Our baristas have won global accolades and we love serving
          cuppa goodness
